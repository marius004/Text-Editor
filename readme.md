## Description
This is a simple text editor I developed using Java and JavaFX. I forced myself not to use MVC(an architectural design pattern). Instead, I used the Observable, Null Object and Memento design patterns.  This project proved to be enjoyable because I got to practice the newly learned design patterns. I also tried to respect the SOLID principles as much as possible.
