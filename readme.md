This is a simple text editor I developed using JavaFX. I forced myself not to use MVC(an architectural design pattern). Instead, I used the Observable, Null Object and Memento design patterns.  This project proved to be enjoyable because I got to practice the newly learned design patterns. I tried to respect the OOD and the SOLID principles as much as possible. So, if you have any ideas/suggestions please contact me.

Also when cloning this project: 
Don't forget to install and link javafx to the project.
